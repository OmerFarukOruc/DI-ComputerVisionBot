This Python script is designed to automate the process of defeating a specific boss in a game. It uses computer vision techniques and simulation of keyboard keys and mouse clicks to navigate through the game and attack the boss.

Getting Started
Before running the script, make sure you have the following libraries installed:
1. OpenCV
2. NumPy
3. PyAutoGUI
4. pywin32

Usage:
1. Open the Diablo Immortal game and make sure the game window is active.
2. Run the script.
3. The script will automatically detect and click the "Enter Raid" button, then click the "Enter" button in the raid menu.
4. The script will move the character to the Ashava boss location.
5. The script will automatically attack the boss using primary attacks and skills at pre-defined intervals.
6. Once the boss is defeated, the script will loot the items and restart the process.
7. Each pre-defined runs completed it salvages all loot in blacksmith. In order to salvage properly, character should still stand close to blacksmith by default. (At least for now.^^)
